    <p>"Only when you look at yourself as a NATION can
        you change things”...<br>  -Dr. Amos Wilson<br><br>
        The words of Dr. Amos Wilson ring as true today as they did when he uttered them over 20 years
        ago.<br><br>
        
        For decades our people have analyzed and deliberated our trials and tribulations.<br><br> We have
        fought, protested, even died, in the struggle for what we truly believed was our only solution:<br><br>
        
        “Confront the white man and demand that he treats us as equals”.</p>
        <p>Throughout our history we have displayed boundless energy, incredible strength, and
        unparalleled resilience.<br><br> Despite our best efforts, nothing we have attempted has yielded exclusive
        results for our African people...<br><br> UNTIL NOW!
        OUR COMMITMENT:<br>
        “Our Africa Plan” is our commitment to the AFRICAN DIASPORA!<br><br> This is accomplished by
        providing an accessible platform to invest in our motherland by means of land acquisition.</p>
        <p>OAP along with the real estate expertise of the  Africa Investment Guide  have combined
        forces to provide a service that is:<br>
        <p class="family">Low Risk ● Small Investment ● High Yield</p>
        <br>
        This is an incredibly rare opportunity for the African diaspora.<br><br> We are absolutely convinced that
        this is the most simplified comprehensive pathway to African land acquisition in existence
        today.</p>

        Investing in “Our Africa Plan” is a seamless, transparent, process as outlined and explained in our
