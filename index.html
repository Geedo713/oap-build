<h3>Investment Opportunity</h3>
<p>The words of Dr. Amos Wilson ring as true today as they did when he uttered them over 20 years
    ago. For decades our people have analyzed and deliberated our trials and tribulations. We have
    fought, protested, even died, in the struggle for what we truly believed was our only solution:
    <aside>“Confront the white man and demand that he treats us as equals”.</aside>
    Throughout our history we have displayed boundless energy, incredible strength, and
    unparalleled resilience. Despite our best efforts, nothing we have attempted has yielded exclusive
    results for our African people... UNTIL NOW!</p>
